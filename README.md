[Freek Wiedijk's webpage](http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/) lists
[100 famous theorems](http://pirate.shu.edu/~kahlnath/Top100.html)
and how many of those have been formalised using proof assistants.
This repository keeps track of the statements that have been proved
using the [Coq proof assistant](https://coq.inria.fr/).

You can see the list on [this webpage](https://madiot.fr/coq100).

## Included proofs

This repository also contains Coq proofs of some of the 100 theorems:
- [ballot.v](ballot.v) for the [Ballot Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand%27s_ballot_theorem)
- [birthday.v](birthday.v) for the [Birthday Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem)
- [cardan_ferrari.v](cardan_ferrari.v) for The Solution of a [Cubic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_equation) and the Solution of a [Quartic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartic_equation)
- [div3.v](div3.v) for [Divisibility by 3 Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisibility_rule#Divisibility_by_3_or_9)
- [inclusionexclusion.v](inclusionexclusion.v) for the [Inclusion/Exclusion Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion%E2%80%93exclusion_principle#Statement)
- [konigsberg_bridges.v](konigsberg_bridges.v) for the [Konigsberg Bridges Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg)
- [mean.v](mean.v) for the [Arithmetic Mean/Geometric Mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_of_arithmetic_and_geometric_means#The_inequality)
- [sumarith.v](sumarith.v) for [Sum of an arithmetic series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression#Sum)
- [sumkthpowers.v](sumkthpowers.v) for [Sum of kth powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_polynomials#Sums_of_pth_powers)

## How to add a new statement

To add a new statement for one of the therorems, do not modify `index.html`
directly because it is automatically generated. Instead, edit `statements.yml`.
Then, if you have node installed, generate the index file with
`gen.js > index.html` and check it looks as intended in a browser.
Finally, make a pull request with both files.

If the proof does not belong to another repository, you can also add a single
self-contained `.v` proof file, in which case you should edit `LICENSE.md`
accordingly.
